# README #

This OmniFocus script exports a flat list of active projects to OmniOutliner showing how many days are left until due date. Unlike calendar dates, seeing how many days are left until the due date is more "readable". Also, it gives you a better overview overall.

By default, this script *includes* today's date and *excludes* the due date. This behaviour change be changed by modifying variables `includeStartDate` and `includeEndDate`. These variables are located at the top of the script.

Setting the value to `true` will include the date in the calculations and setting the value to `false` will exclude the date from calculations. The script can be modified using the built-in `Script Editor` app.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Copy script to OmniFocus scripts folder
* Drag script's icon to toolbar

>**Warning** don't forget to set the encoding to `MacRoman` if you are going to edit the script **Warning**
